There are several options for databases when working with Java applications. Here are some popular choices:

MySQL: A widely-used open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is compatible with Java applications. MySQL offers excellent performance, reliability, and ease of use.

PostgreSQL: An advanced open-source relational database system known for its extensibility, SQL compliance, and strong community support. It's compatible with Java through JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).

Oracle Database: A commercial relational database management system developed by Oracle Corporation. It's widely used in enterprise environments and offers comprehensive features for Java integration.

MongoDB: A popular NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model. It's well-suited for Java applications that require flexibility in data structure and scalability.

Apache Derby: A lightweight, open-source relational database implemented entirely in Java. It's often used for development and testing purposes due to its easy setup and embedded deployment capabilities.

H2 Database: Another lightweight, open-source relational database implemented in Java. It supports both in-memory and disk-based storage, making it suitable for various Java applications.

HSQLDB (HyperSQL Database): An open-source relational database management system written in Java. It's known for its small footprint and is often used for embedded database scenarios in Java applications.

Cassandra: A distributed NoSQL database designed for handling large amounts of data across many commodity servers. It's suitable for Java applications requiring high availability and scalability.

Neo4j: A graph database that uses graph structures with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data. It's commonly used in Java applications for scenarios involving complex relationships and network structures.

These are just a few options, and the choice of database depends on factors such as your application requirements, data model, scalability needs, and deployment environment. Each database has its own strengths and weaknesses, so it's essential to evaluate them based on your specific use case.
