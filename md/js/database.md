If you're specifically looking for databases that are designed to be used with JavaScript, especially in the context of web development, here are some options:

IndexedDB: A low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data, including files/blobs. It's supported by most modern browsers and is suitable for web applications that need to store data locally.

LocalStorage: A simple key-value storage mechanism available in web browsers. It's synchronous and has a size limit (typically around 5MB per origin). It's suitable for storing small amounts of data.

Firebase Realtime Database: A cloud-hosted NoSQL database provided by Google as part of the Firebase platform. It allows for real-time synchronization of data across clients and is commonly used in web and mobile applications developed with JavaScript frameworks like React and Angular.

Firebase Firestore: Another cloud-hosted NoSQL database provided by Google as part of the Firebase platform. It offers more advanced querying capabilities compared to the Realtime Database and is also commonly used in web and mobile applications developed with JavaScript frameworks.

MongoDB (with Mongoose): While MongoDB itself is a NoSQL database commonly used with JavaScript-based technologies like Node.js for server-side development, Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, designed to work in an asynchronous environment. It provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model application data.

PouchDB: A JavaScript database that syncs with CouchDB-compatible databases like CouchDB and IBM Cloudant. It's designed for offline-first web applications and is commonly used with frameworks like Angular and React.

NeDB: A lightweight embedded JavaScript database inspired by MongoDB's query syntax. It's written in pure JavaScript and can be used with Node.js applications for local data storage.

These databases are commonly used with JavaScript for various use cases, including web development, mobile app development, and server-side development with Node.js. The choice of database depends on factors like the type of application, data requirements, and scalability needs.
