If you're specifically looking for client-side databases, which typically run within the user's browser or on a mobile device, here are some options:

IndexedDB: A low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data, including files/blobs. It's supported by most modern browsers.

LocalStorage: A simple key-value storage mechanism available in web browsers. It's synchronous and has a size limit (typically around 5MB per origin).

WebSQL: A deprecated client-side database API that provides a lightweight SQL database engine. Although it's deprecated, some older browsers still support it.

SQLite: A popular relational database engine that can be embedded within mobile applications and web browsers using wrappers like SQL.js.

PouchDB: As mentioned earlier, PouchDB is a JavaScript database that syncs with CouchDB-compatible databases and is designed to work offline.

LocalForage: A JavaScript library that improves the offline experience of web apps by using asynchronous storage (IndexedDB or WebSQL) with a simple, localStorage-like API.

WatermelonDB: An open-source, reactive database for React and React Native applications. It's optimized for performance by using SQLite under the hood.

These client-side databases vary in terms of features, performance, and compatibility. Choose the one that best fits your project's requirements and platform constraints.
